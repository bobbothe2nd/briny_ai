# Workspace: `briny_ai`

The crate is not as simple as it was previously, steps are being taken towards a full on AI/ML library rather than a basic `tensor + autodiff` engine. It has crates accompanying it that are specific to `briny_ai` like the macros crate, not meant for use outside of the internal library.

That's why it's been switched to a library. The directories inside this repository are the names of the crates.
